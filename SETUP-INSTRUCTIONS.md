# Controlled Chaos v4 - Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up cross-device sync and AI features for Controlled Chaos v4.

## Part 1: Deploy Cloudflare Worker (API Proxy)

The Cloudflare Worker acts as a secure proxy for the Anthropic API, allowing the app to work from any device without CORS issues.

### Step 1: Create Cloudflare Account
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up
2. Sign up for a free account (no credit card required)
3. Verify your email

### Step 2: Deploy the Worker
1. Log in to Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Click **Workers & Pages** in the left sidebar
3. Click **Create Application**
4. Click **Create Worker**
5. Give it a name like `anthropic-proxy` (or any name you like)
6. Click **Deploy**
7. After deployment, click **Edit Code**
8. Delete all the default code
9. Copy the entire contents of `anthropic-proxy.js` from this project
10. Paste it into the Cloudflare editor
11. Click **Save and Deploy**

### Step 3: Get Your Worker URL
1. After deploying, you'll see your worker URL at the top
2. It will look like: `https://anthropic-proxy.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev`
3. **Copy this URL** - you'll need it later
4. Your API endpoint will be: `https://anthropic-proxy.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev/api/claude`

‚úÖ **Cloudflare Worker is now deployed!**

6. Click **Create**
7. Wait for the project to be created (takes a few seconds)

### Step 2: Enable Google Drive API
1. In the Google Cloud Console, make sure your new project is selected
2. Go to **APIs & Services** > **Library** (or visit https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library)
3. Search for "Google Drive API"
4. Click on **Google Drive API**
5. Click **Enable**

### Step 3: Create OAuth Credentials

7. Name it "Controlled Chaos Web"
8. Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, click **Add URI** and add:
   - `http://localhost` (for local testing)
   - `file://` (for opening HTML file directly)
   - Any other domains where you'll host the app
9. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the same URIs
10. Click **Create**
11. **Copy your Client ID** - it will look like: `123456789-abcdefg.apps.googleusercontent.com`

‚úÖ **Google Drive API is now enabled!**

## Part 3: Configure the App

### Step 1: Update the HTML File
1. Open `controlled-chaos-v4.html` in a text editor
2. Find this line near the top of the `<script>` section:
   ```javascript
   const CLOUDFLARE_WORKER_URL = 'YOUR-WORKER-URL-HERE';
   const GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR-CLIENT-ID-HERE';
   ```
3. Replace `YOUR-WORKER-URL-HERE` with your Cloudflare Worker URL from Part 1, Step 3
   - Example: `https://anthropic-proxy.myname.workers.dev/api/claude`
4. Replace `YOUR-CLIENT-ID-HERE` with your Google Client ID from Part 2, Step 3
   - Example: `123456789-abcdefg.apps.googleusercontent.com`
5. Save the file

### Step 2: Open the App
1. Double-click `controlled-chaos-v4.html` to open it in your browser
2. You should see a **"Sign in with Google"** button
3. Click it and sign in with your Google account
4. Grant permission to access Google Drive
5. The app will now save all your data to Google Drive!

‚úÖ **App is now configured!**

## Part 4: Add Your Anthropic API Key

1. In the app, click **Settings** (‚öôÔ∏è)
2. Paste your Anthropic API key
3. Click **Save Settings**
4. Your API key is stored securely in Google Drive (not in the Cloudflare Worker)

‚úÖ **AI features are now enabled!**

## How It Works

### Data Storage
- All your tasks, schedule, and settings are saved to Google Drive as `controlled-chaos-data.json`
- Changes sync automatically across all your devices
- Works offline - changes are queued and synced when you're back online

### API Proxy
- When you use AI features (Brain Dump, I'm Stuck), the app sends requests to your Cloudflare Worker
- The worker forwards them to Anthropic's API with your API key
- This avoids CORS issues and works from any device

### Security
- Your API key is stored in Google Drive (encrypted by Google)
- The Cloudflare Worker never stores your API key
- Only you can access your Google Drive data

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Sign in with Google" button doesn't work
- Make sure you added the correct Client ID in the HTML file
- Check that you enabled the Google Drive API
- Try opening the file in a different browser

### AI features not working
- Make sure you deployed the Cloudflare Worker correctly
- Check that you added the correct Worker URL in the HTML file
- Verify your Anthropic API key is valid

### Data not syncing
- Make sure you're signed in to Google
- Check your internet connection
- Try clicking "Sign in with Google" again

### Worker deployment failed
- Make sure you copied the entire `anthropic-proxy.js` file
- Check that there are no syntax errors
- Try deploying again

## Need Help?

If you run into issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
2. Make sure all URLs and IDs are correct
3. Try signing out and signing back in to Google
4. Redeploy the Cloudflare Worker

## Privacy & Security

- **Your data**: Stored in YOUR Google Drive, encrypted by Google
- **Your API key**: Stored in YOUR Google Drive, never sent to Cloudflare
- **The Worker**: Only forwards requests, doesn't store anything
- **Open source**: All code is visible in the HTML file

You're in complete control of your data! üîí‚ú®
