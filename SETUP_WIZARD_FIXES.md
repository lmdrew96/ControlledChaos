## Technical Details

### Data Structure
```javascript
data: {
    courses: [],           // Array of course name strings
    scheduleBlocks: [],    // Array of {day, title, start, end}
    templates: [],         // Array of {name, tasks[]}
    projects: [],          // Array of {name, description, tasks[]} (NEW)
    enableMoodTracker: true,
    maxWorkTime: 90,
    useDyslexicFont: false
}
```

### Project Saving Logic
Projects are converted to the app's data format with proper structure:
```javascript
{
    id: unique_id,
    name: string,
    description: string,
    tasks: [
        {
            id: unique_id,
            text: string,
            completed: false
        }
    ]
}
```

### Error Handling
- Try-catch block wraps entire `complete()` function
- Console logs at each major step for debugging
- User-friendly error alert if something fails
- Prevents data corruption by checking for duplicates

### Close Functionality
- `close()` method removes all possible modal elements:
  - setupWizardModal
  - scheduleBlockForm
  - templateForm
  - projectForm
- Background click handler on main modal
- Ã— button styled consistently across all steps
