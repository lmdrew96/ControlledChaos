# UI Improvements Summary

## Date: October 14, 2025

This document summarizes three UI improvements implemented to enhance user control and fix rendering issues.

---

## Fix 1: Floating "0%" Bug on Projects Tab ✅

**Problem:** The "0%" progress indicator was rendering OUTSIDE the ScribeCat project card instead of inside it.

**Root Cause:** The `.project-progress-text` CSS class used `position: absolute` but the parent container `.project-progress-container` didn't have `position: relative`, causing the absolutely positioned text to float outside its intended container.

**Solution:** Added `position: relative` to `.project-progress-container` in `styles.css` to properly constrain the absolutely positioned percentage text.

**Files Modified:**
- `styles.css` - Added `position: relative` to `.project-progress-container`

## Fix 2: Mood Tracker Toggle in Settings ✅

**Problem:** Users had no way to disable the Mood Tracker feature if they didn't want to use it.

**Solution:** Added a toggle switch in the Settings > Preferences section that allows users to enable/disable the Mood Tracker feature. When disabled, the "Quick Mood" and "Mood Patterns" buttons are hidden from the header.

**Implementation Details:**
- Toggle preference is saved to `localStorage` (key: `moodTrackerEnabled`)
- Default state: enabled (for backward compatibility)
- Buttons are shown/hidden dynamically based on preference
- Toast notification confirms the change

**Files Modified:**
- `index.html` - Added checkbox toggle in Preferences section
- `misc.js` - Added `toggleMoodTracker()` and `initializeMoodTrackerToggle()` functions
- `app.js` - Added call to `initializeMoodTrackerToggle()` during app initialization

## Fix 3: Energy Tracking in Mood Tracker ✅

**Problem:** The morning check-in modal was missing energy level tracking, while other check-ins (evening, post-intense activity) already had it.

**Solution:** Added an energy level selector to the morning check-in modal to maintain consistency across all mood tracking features.

**Implementation Details:**
- Added energy selector UI using `MoodUI.energySelector('morningEnergy')`
- Updated `saveMorningCheckIn()` to capture and save the energy level
- Energy data is now stored in the check-in object with the `energyLevel` property
- Energy levels range from 1-5 (💤 😴 😐 ⚡ 🚀)

**Files Modified:**
- `mood-tracker/check-ins.js` - Added energy selector to morning modal and updated save function
