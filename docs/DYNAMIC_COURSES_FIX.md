# Dynamic Courses Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
The "Deadlines by Course" section was using a hardcoded `COURSES` object that only worked for specific courses (Biology, Beatles, US Politics, World History). This prevented the app from working for other users with different courses.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Dynamic Course Generation (courses.js)

**Before:**
- `renderCourseDeadlineView()` relied on the hardcoded `COURSES` object
- Only showed sections for predefined courses
- Used `COURSES[courseId]` to get course info

**After:**
- Dynamically extracts unique courses from actual deadline data
- Generates course sections based on what's in `appData.deadlines`
- Uses dynamic color palette and icons for any number of courses
- No dependency on hardcoded course definitions

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// Get all unique courses from deadlines (DYNAMIC - no hardcoded COURSES)
const uniqueCourses = [...new Set(appData.deadlines
    .filter(d => !d.completed)
    .map(d => d.class || d.course)
    .filter(c => c && c !== 'Personal')
)];

// Generate color palette dynamically
const colors = ['#8b5cf6', '#10b981', '#f59e0b', '#3b82f6', '#ec4899', '#06b6d4', '#84cc16', '#f43f5e'];
const icons = ['📚', '🧬', '🎵', '🏛️', '💻', '🔬', '📐', '🎨'];

// Render section for each course found in the data
uniqueCourses.forEach((courseName, index) => {
    const courseColor = colors[index % colors.length];
    const courseIcon = icons[index % icons.length];
    // ... render course section
});
```

### 2. Course Mapping Management (Already Implemented)

The course mapping functionality was already present in the codebase:

**Location:** Settings tab → Course Mappings section

**Features:**
- View all existing course code mappings (e.g., BISC104 → Biology)
- Add new mappings manually via "Add Course Mapping" button
- Delete existing mappings
- Mappings are stored in `appData.courseMappings`
- Used during calendar/syllabus import to map course codes to friendly names

**Functions:**
- `getCourseMappings()` - Get all mappings
- `getCourseMappingForCode(code)` - Get mapping for specific code
- `saveCourseMappings(mappings)` - Save mappings to storage
- `renderCourseMappings()` - Display mappings in UI
- `showAddCourseMappingModal()` - Add new mapping
- `deleteCourseMappingConfirm(code)` - Delete mapping

### 3. Updated showCourseTasksModal Function

**Before:**
```javascript
function showCourseTasksModal(courseId, deadlineId) {
    const course = COURSES[courseId];  // Hardcoded lookup
    // ...
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
function showCourseTasksModal(courseName, deadlineId) {
    // Uses courseName directly, no hardcoded lookup needed
    // ...
}
```

## How It Works Now

### For New Users:
1. User imports calendar/syllabus with course codes (e.g., CHEM101, HIST202)
2. System prompts to map codes to friendly names (e.g., CHEM101 → Chemistry)
3. Deadlines are tagged with the friendly course names
4. "Deadlines by Course" section automatically shows sections for Chemistry, History, etc.
5. Colors and icons are assigned dynamically from the palette

### For Existing Users:
1. Existing deadlines with `class` or `course` fields are automatically detected
2. Unique course names are extracted from the data
3. Sections appear for whatever courses exist in the data
4. No migration needed - works with existing data structure

### Personal/Uncategorized Deadlines:
- Deadlines without a course assignment (or marked as "Personal") appear in a separate "Personal" section
- This ensures nothing is lost even if not mapped to a course

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User with Different Courses
- User has courses: Chemistry, Physics, Math, English
- Each course appears as a separate section with unique color/icon
- No hardcoded course names appear

### Scenario 2: User with Many Courses
- User has 10+ courses
- Colors/icons cycle through the palette (using modulo operator)
- All courses display correctly

### Scenario 3: User with No Course Mappings
- User imports deadlines without mapping course codes
- Deadlines appear in "Personal" section
- User can add mappings later in Settings

### Scenario 4: Mixed Mapped/Unmapped
- Some deadlines have course assignments, others don't
- Course sections appear for mapped courses
- Personal section appears for unmapped items

## Benefits

1. **User-Agnostic**: Works for any user with any courses
2. **No Configuration Required**: Automatically adapts to imported data
3. **Flexible**: Supports unlimited number of courses
4. **Backward Compatible**: Works with existing data structure
5. **Maintainable**: No need to update hardcoded course lists

## Files Modified

1. **courses.js**
   - `renderCourseDeadlineView()` - Complete rewrite for dynamic rendering
   - `showCourseTasksModal()` - Updated to use courseName instead of courseId

## Files Unchanged (Already Working)

1. **ui.js** - Course mapping UI functions already present
2. **calendar-import.js** - Course detection and mapping already implemented
3. **storage.js** - Course mappings storage already implemented
4. **index.html** - Course mappings section already in Settings tab

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix works:

1. ✅ Open the app and navigate to Tasks & Deadlines tab
2. ✅ Check "Deadlines by Course" section
3. ✅ Verify it shows actual courses from your data (not hardcoded ones)
4. ✅ Go to Settings → Course Mappings
5. ✅ Verify you can add/edit/delete course mappings
6. ✅ Import a calendar with different course codes
7. ✅ Verify new courses appear in "Deadlines by Course" section

## Notes

- The hardcoded `COURSES` object still exists in courses.js but is only used for legacy functions like `detectCourseFromText()` and `pickTaskWithCourseContext()`
- These legacy functions could be refactored in the future to also be fully dynamic
- The main user-facing "Deadlines by Course" view is now completely dynamic and user-agnostic
