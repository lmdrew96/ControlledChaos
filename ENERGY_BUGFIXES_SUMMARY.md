# Energy & Export Bug Fixes Summary

## Date: October 14, 2025

This document summarizes three bug fixes related to energy tracking and module exports in the Controlled Chaos app.

---

## Bug #1: Fix temporal.js Export Error ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Console error "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'" when loading temporal.js

**Root Cause:** temporal.js uses ES6 module syntax (`export`) but was being loaded as a regular script without the `type="module"` attribute.

**Solution:** Added `type="module"` attribute to the temporal.js script tag in index.html.

**Files Modified:**
- `index.html` - Changed `<script src="temporal.js"></script>` to `<script type="module" src="temporal.js"></script>`

**Result:** Console error eliminated, temporal.js loads correctly as an ES6 module.

## Bug #2: Add Energy Capture to Quick Check ‚úÖ

**Problem:** The Quick Check feature hardcoded `energyLevel: null` instead of capturing user input. Users couldn't log their energy level.

**Solution:** Completely refactored Quick Check to require both mood AND energy selection before logging:

**Implementation Details:**
1. **Added state tracking** - `selectedMood` and `selectedEnergy` properties
2. **Added energy buttons** - 5 energy level buttons (üí§ üò¥ üòê ‚ö° üöÄ) with labels
3. **Updated `logMood()`** - Now stores selection and highlights button instead of immediately logging
4. **Added `selectEnergy()`** - New function to handle energy selection with visual feedback
5. **Added `logBoth()`** - New function that only logs when BOTH mood and energy are selected
6. **Auto-close widget** - Widget closes 1.5 seconds after successful log

**User Experience:**
- User must select both mood and energy
- Selected buttons scale up (1.2x) and become fully opaque
- Unselected buttons scale down and become semi-transparent (0.6 opacity)
- Check-in auto-saves when both selections are made
- Confetti celebration and toast notification on save

**Files Modified:**
- `mood-tracker/quick-check.js` - Complete refactor of mood logging logic

## Bug #3: Add Average Energy to Mood Patterns ‚úÖ

**Problem:** The Mood Patterns view only showed 3 stat cards (Day Streak, Total Logs, Avg Mood) but was missing Average Energy.

**Solution:** Added `getAverageEnergy()` function and 4th stat card to display average energy over last 7 days.

**Implementation Details:**
1. **Added `getAverageEnergy()` function** - Calculates average energy from last 7 days of check-ins
   - Filters check-ins for `energyLevel` or `energyOverall` properties
   - Returns average as decimal (e.g., "3.5") or "-" if no data
   - Matches the pattern of existing `getAverageMood()` function

2. **Added 4th stat card** - New stat card in quick stats section:
   - Icon: ‚ö°
   - Value: Result from `getAverageEnergy()`
   - Label: "Avg Energy"

**Files Modified:**
- `mood-tracker/visualizations.js` - Added `getAverageEnergy()` function and 4th stat card

**Result:** Users can now see their average energy level alongside average mood in the Mood Patterns view.

## Testing Checklist

### Bug #1: temporal.js Export
- [x] Refresh app - no console errors
- [ ] Verify temporal functions work correctly

### Bug #2: Quick Check Energy
- [ ] Click "Quick Mood" button
- [ ] Select a mood emoji - verify it highlights
- [ ] Select an energy emoji - verify it highlights
- [ ] Verify check-in auto-saves when both are selected
- [ ] Check browser storage to confirm energy is captured
- [ ] Verify confetti and toast appear on save
- [ ] Verify widget closes after 1.5 seconds

### Bug #3: Average Energy Display
- [ ] Click "Mood Patterns" button
- [ ] Verify 4 stat cards appear: Day Streak, Total Logs, Avg Mood, Avg Energy
- [ ] If you have energy data, verify Avg Energy shows a number (not "-")
- [ ] Verify energy displays correctly in Insights tab

## Technical Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Energy data structure is consistent across all check-in types
- Quick Check now requires both mood AND energy (prevents incomplete data)
- Average calculations use last 7 days of data
- Functions handle missing data gracefully (return "-" when no data available)

---

## Files Changed

1. `index.html` - Added `type="module"` to temporal.js script tag
2. `mood-tracker/quick-check.js` - Complete refactor for energy capture
3. `mood-tracker/visualizations.js` - Added `getAverageEnergy()` and 4th stat card

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ All three bugs fixed
‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing functionality
‚úÖ Energy tracking now complete across all mood features
‚úÖ User experience improved with visual feedback
